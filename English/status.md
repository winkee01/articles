# Is CFD (continuation for dismissal) available in Texas?


Yes, **Continuation for Dismissal (CFD)**, or similar agreements, are available in Texas under specific circumstances. This type of arrangement is often referred to as a **Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA)** or **Pretrial Diversion Program** in Texas. While the term "CFD" might not be commonly used in Texas, the concept of continuing a case for dismissal after meeting specific conditions is very much part of the criminal justice system in the state.

### **How CFD/Deferred Prosecution Works in Texas**
1. **Purpose**:
   - The goal is to allow eligible defendants to avoid a conviction by meeting certain conditions set by the court or the prosecutor.
   - If the defendant complies with all terms, the charges are dismissed, and no conviction is entered on the criminal record.

2. **Eligibility**:
   - Typically available for first-time offenders or individuals charged with non-violent offenses.
   - Common charges eligible for this type of agreement include:
     - Minor theft
     - Drug possession (small amounts)
     - Criminal mischief
     - Some Class B and Class C misdemeanors
   - Eligibility is determined by the prosecutor and often depends on the defendant’s criminal history, the nature of the offense, and other factors.

3. **Conditions for Dismissal**:
   - The defendant may need to meet specific requirements, such as:
     - Completing community service
     - Paying restitution to any victims
     - Attending educational programs (e.g., drug or alcohol awareness classes)
     - Staying out of legal trouble during the deferral period
     - Avoiding contact with the victim (in applicable cases)
   - These conditions are usually tailored to the offense and defendant’s circumstances.

4. **Duration**:
   - The case is usually continued (postponed) for a specific period, often 6 to 12 months, while the defendant fulfills the conditions.

5. **Outcome**:
   - **If successful**: The charges are dismissed, and the defendant avoids a criminal conviction.
   - **If not successful**: If the defendant fails to comply with the conditions, the prosecutor can reinstate the case and proceed to trial.

### **Benefits of CFD/Deferred Prosecution**
- **No Conviction**: Avoids a formal conviction, which can significantly reduce the long-term impact on employment, housing, and other areas of life.
- **Expungement**: After the charges are dismissed, the defendant may be eligible to have the arrest and case expunged from their record.
- **No Jail Time**: Typically, these agreements are an alternative to incarceration.

### **How to Pursue CFD/Deferred Prosecution in Texas**
1. **Negotiate with the Prosecutor**:
   - Your attorney can approach the prosecutor to request this type of agreement if you meet the eligibility requirements.

2. **Comply with All Conditions**:
   - Make sure to follow the court’s requirements carefully. Failure to comply could result in losing the opportunity for dismissal.

3. **Understand Local Policies**:
   - Different counties and jurisdictions in Texas may have specific pretrial diversion programs or policies that align with the concept of CFD.

### **Key Considerations**
- **Not Automatically Granted**: These agreements are typically discretionary, meaning it’s up to the prosecutor to offer them.
- **Consult an Attorney**: Having a skilled defense attorney can increase your chances of negotiating a favorable agreement.
