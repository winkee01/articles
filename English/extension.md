Maintaining **legal status** in the U.S. until June 28, 2025, in this situation requires careful planning and timely action. Here's a step-by-step guide to address the potential loss of status and strategies to extend it:

---

### **1. Current B-2 Visa Extension**
- Since you applied for an extension of your B-2 visa on **October 28**, before your status expired on **November 4**, you are in a **"period of authorized stay"** while USCIS processes your extension request. This means you are not accruing unlawful presence during this time.
- If your extension is approved, it may grant you an additional 6 months, likely until **April 28, 2025**.

---

### **2. Timeline of Status**
- If your B-2 extension is approved for 6 months:
  - **Valid until April 28, 2025**.
  - Your obligations under the DA/Judge's offer extend until **June 28, 2025**.
- This creates a **2-month gap** where you would no longer have legal status unless you take further steps to extend it.

### **3. Options to Maintain Status Until June 28**
To bridge this gap and ensure you remain in legal status, consider the following options:

#### **A. File Another B-2 Extension (Second I-539)**
- You may file a second **Form I-539** to request an additional B-2 extension before the first extension expires on **April 28, 2025**.
- In the second extension application:
  - Provide a detailed explanation of why you need to remain in the U.S. until **June 28, 2025** (e.g., to fulfill court obligations as required by the DA or Judge).
  - Include supporting documentation, such as:
    - A letter from the DA or court outlining the specific requirements and timeline of your obligations.
    - Evidence that you are complying with the court's conditions (e.g., progress reports on community service or classes).
- Filing the second I-539 application **before April 28, 2025** will allow you to remain in a **period of authorized stay** while USCIS processes the application.

#### **B. Change to Another Visa Status**
If a second B-2 extension is not feasible or likely to be denied, consider switching to a different visa status:

1. **F-1 Student Visa**:
   - If you enroll in a full-time academic or language program at an SEVP-certified school, you can apply to change your status to an F-1 visa.
   - This requires obtaining a Form I-20 from the school and filing Form I-539 to change your status.
   - Ensure that your intent to study is genuine and aligns with the program's requirements.

2. **J-1 Exchange Visitor Visa**:
   - If you qualify for a J-1 program (e.g., an internship, training, or cultural exchange program), you can request a change to J-1 status.
   - Work with a designated sponsor to obtain a Form DS-2019 and file Form I-539 for the change.

---

#### **C. Consider Leaving and Reapplying for a Visa**
- If extending or changing status is not possible within the U.S., you may need to leave the U.S. and reapply for a new visa at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country.
- **Challenges**:
  - You must explain the pending legal obligations to the consular officer.
  - If your criminal or legal record raises concerns, this could impact visa approval.

### **4. Addressing Possible Risks**
- **Unlawful Presence**:
  - If no extension or status change is filed, and you remain in the U.S. past April 28, 2025 (assuming the extension is approved), you may begin accruing **unlawful presence**, which can have severe immigration consequences:
    - 180+ days of unlawful presence = 3-year ban on reentry.
    - 1+ year of unlawful presence = 10-year ban on reentry.
- **Proactive Filing**:
  - To avoid these issues, ensure any extension or change of status is filed **before your current status expires**.

---

### **5. Best Course of Action**
1. **Monitor Your Current Extension Decision**:
   - If the current B-2 extension is approved, calculate the new expiration date and plan to file for another extension at least 45 days before it expires.

2. **Communicate with the DA or Judge**:
   - Ask for a letter or documentation confirming the obligations you need to fulfill and the required timeline. This will strengthen your case for a second extension or change of status.

3. **Consult an Immigration Attorney**:
   - Work with an experienced immigration attorney to craft a strong application for either a second B-2 extension or a change of status to a visa that fits your situation.

4. **File on Time**:
   - Ensure that any subsequent application (extension or change of status) is submitted **before April 28, 2025** to remain in authorized stay.

---

### **6. Summary of Steps**
1. Wait for the decision on your current B-2 extension (likely until April 28, 2025).
2. If approved, prepare to file a second B-2 extension (or a change of status) before the first extension expires.
3. Provide detailed evidence of your obligations and reasons for needing to stay until June 28, 2025.
4. Avoid accruing unlawful presence by ensuring all applications are timely filed.
