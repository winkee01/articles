# The alternative

This alternative is [**OrbStack**](https://orbstack.dev/), which is a fast, light, and simple way to run containers and Linux machines on macOS. It‚Äôs a supercharged alternative to Docker Desktop and all in one easy-to-use app.

There are several compelling reasons to use Orbstack, but the main ones are:

-   ‚ö°Ô∏è **Fast.** It starts in 2 seconds, has an optimized [**network**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/docker/network) and file system, and fast x86 emulation.

-   üí® **Lightweight.** It consumes low CPU and disk usage, and it‚Äôs [**battery-friendly**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/benchmarks) compared to Docker Desktop.

-   üç∞ **Simple.** It‚Äôs simple to use and comes with CLI & [**container/image/volume file access**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/features/native-files), VPN, and SSH support.
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Powerful.** You can run [**Docker containers**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/docker/), [**Kubernetes**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/kubernetes/), and [**Linux distros**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/machines/) and manage containers from your [**menu bar**](https://docs.orbstack.dev/menu-bar).

And it comes with all of the necessary features of Docker Desktop, such as checking the logs, containers, and images and viewing container logs. Everything you need is right there.

Unfortunately, it‚Äôs currently only for Mac users, but I guess there will be faster alternatives for Windows users as well, like [Rancher Desktop](https://rancherdesktop.io/) or [Podman](https://podman.io/).

So give it a try if you‚Äôre on macOS, and I‚Äôm sure you won‚Äôt regret it. It will save your operating system so much memory and CPU.

PS. This is not sponsored by Orbstack; I‚Äôm simply sharing my experience and the tools I use in my daily development tasks.
